## 3.0.0 2019-04-24


### Added

- Join DSL so that you can use arbitrary conditions when joining relations (flash-gordon)
  ```ruby
  users.join(tasks) { |users:, tasks:|
    tasks[:user_id].is(users[:id]) & users[:name].is('John')
  }
  ```
  You also can use table aliases, however the setup is a bit hairy:
  ```ruby
  # self-join "users" with itself using "authors" as an alias
  authors = users.as(:authors).qualified(:authors)
  result = users.join(authors) { |users: |
    users[:id].is(authors[:id])
  }.select(:name)
  ```
- Support for `CASE` expression (wmaciejak + flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
  # matching expression result
  users.select_append { id.case(1 => string('one'), else: string('something else')).as(:one_or_else) }

  # searching for `true` result
  users.select_append { string::case(id.is(1) => 'one', else: 'else').as(:one_or_else) }
  ```
- Relations can be accessed in DSLs with keyword arguments (flash-gordon)
  ```ruby
  users.join(posts).select_append { |posts: | posts[:title] }
  ```
- Support for `.exists` in the projection DSL (flash-gordon)
  ```ruby
  users.select_append { |posts: |
    exists(posts.where(posts[:user_id] => id)).as(:has_posts)
  }
  ```
- `Relation#unfiltered` returns an unrestricted relation (removes restrictions from `WHERE` and `HAVING`) (flash-gordon)
- Support for `WITHIN GROUP` in the function DSL has been enhanced with block syntax (flash-gordon)
- ```ruby
- # previously available version
- households.project { float::percentile_cont(0.5).within_group(income).as(:percentile) }
- # using the new syntax
- households.project { float::percentile_cont(0.5).within_group { income }.as(:percentile) }
- ```
- Support for migrator options ie `ROM::Configuration.new(:sql, migrator: { path: "my_migrations" })` (rawburt)
- `Relation#pluck` works with multiple args too (timriley)

### Fixed

  user_tasks = tasks.where(tasks[:user_id].is(users[:id])
  tasks_count = user_tasks.select { integer::count(id) }.query
  users.select_append(tasks_count.as(:tasks_count))
  ```

## 2.2.0 2017-11-02


### Added

- Relation registry is passed as an argument to DSL blocks (in `select`, `where`, `order` etc.), which enables syntax like `select { |r| [id, r.tasks[:title]] }` (solnic)
- Support for self-referenced many-to-many associations (solnic)
- PG's geometric types include meta data about db types (GustavoCaso)

### Fixed

- Custom schema is used correctly in command results (solnic)

### Added

- Support for schema plugins (flash-gordon)
- Support for auto migrations (flash-gordon)
- Add DLS for describing table indexes (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
    schema do
      indexes do
        index :name, name: :unique_name, unique: true
        index :props, type: :gin
        index :name, name: :long_names_only, predicate: 'length(name) > 10'
        index :user_id, :title, name: :composite_idx
      end
    end
  ```
- Support for composite indexes in the auto-restrictions plugin (flash-gordon)
- `SQL::Gateway#call` calls a SQL function (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
    gateway.(:upper, 'foo') # => "FOO"
    gateway.(:pg_advisory_xact_lock, 1234) # => nil
  ```
- `SQL::Gateway#run` executes a SQL string, e.g. a DDL statement (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
    gateway.run('set session IntervalStyle to default')
  ```
- `SQL::Relation#exists` joins a relation with the `EXISTS` operator (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
    users.exists(posts) # => users with posts
  ```
- Support for processing a relation in batches (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
    users.each_batch(size: 100) do |rel|
      rel.
        command(:update).
        call(name: users[:first_name].concat(users[:last_name])
    end
  ```
- `SQL::Relation#import` inserts data from another relation using the `INSERT ... AS SELECT` syntax which is often far more effective than row-by-row processing and an ordinary multi-insert. Relations defined on another gateway are also supported, and in this case, the implementation falls back to the multi-insert strategy (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
    users.import(authors.select { first_name.concat(last_name).as(:name) })
  ```
- Support for `tinytext`, `text`, `mediumtext`, and `longtext data types in MySQL (panthomakos)

  ```ruby
    employees.select { [dep_no, salary, integer::avg(salary).over(partition: dep_no, order: id).as(:avg_salary)] }
  ```
- Function result can be negated, also `ROM::SQL::Function#not` was added (flash-gordon)

  ```ruby
     users.where { !lower(name).is('John') }
     users.where { lower(name).not('John') }
  ```

### Fixed

- Aliased associations with custom FKs work correctly (solnic)
- Defining a custom dataset block no longer prevents default views like `by_pk` to be defined (solnic)
- `Relation#group` uses canonical schema now (solnic)

### Changed

- [BREAKING] based on rom 4.0 now (flash-gordon + solnic)
- [BREAKING] `Associates` command plugin requires associations now (solnic)

- `ManyToOne` no longer uses a join (solnic)
- `AutoCombine` and `AutoWrap` plugins were removed as this functionality is provided by core API (solnic)
- Foreign keys are indexed by default (flash-gordon)
- Schemas are qualified by default (solnic)
